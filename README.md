# Youth Drug Use Analysis & Evidence-Based Policy Strategy  
Statistical Modelling & Public Health Intervention Design

## Research Objective

Illicit drug use among young adults represents a major public health concern.  

This project analyses survey data to:

- Identify demographic and behavioural patterns of drug use  
- Examine predictors of help-seeking behaviour  
- Evaluate the impact of family environment and initiation factors  
- Design data-driven prevention and intervention strategies  

The objective is to translate statistical evidence into actionable public policy recommendations.

## Methodology

- Descriptive statistical analysis  
- Confidence interval estimation  
- One-way ANOVA  
- Chi-square tests of independence  
- Logistic regression modelling  
- Odds ratio interpretation  
- ROC curve & model evaluation (AUC analysis)  
- Population-level projection estimates  

Sample size: n = 200  
Target population: N ≈ 2,000 young individuals  

## Key Findings

### 1. Demographic Profile
- Mean age: 22.69 years  
- Median age: 22 years  
- Drug spending positively skewed (mean = $175.55/month)  

**Insight:** Early adulthood is the critical intervention window.

### 2. Family Environment
- 51.5% report supportive family environments  
- 48.5% report some degree of strain  
- No significant difference in spending by family relationship quality (ANOVA p = 0.681)

**Insight:** Family dynamics influence initiation but not consumption intensity.

### 3. Reasons for Initiation
Top drivers:
- Easy availability  
- Curiosity  
- Family problems  
- Peer pressure  
- Escapism  

Chi-square test showed no association between initiation reason and current help-seeking.

**Insight:** Prevention must address multiple risk pathways simultaneously.

### 4. Help-Seeking Behaviour

- 77% expressed desire for help  
- 95% CI: 71.5% – 82.5%  
- ≈ 1,540 individuals receptive to intervention in population  

### Logistic Regression Results

- Importance of health is a significant predictor of help-seeking  
  (OR = 1.615, p = 0.003)  
- Monthly spending: marginally non-significant  
- Family relationship quality: not significant  

### Model Performance

- ROC AUC = 0.686  
- Moderate predictive ability  

**Insight:** Health-focused messaging is the strongest lever for engagement.

## Policy Recommendations

### 1. Health-Centered Messaging
- Frame addiction as a healthcare issue  
- Use wellbeing-focused campaigns  
- Collaborate with healthcare & wellness influencers  

### 2. Multi-Channel Prevention Strategy
Resource allocation:
- 40% universal prevention  
- 35% early intervention  
- 25% intensive treatment  

Priority channels:
- School programs  
- Community events  
- Social media campaigns  
- Peer ambassadors  

### 3. Tiered Intervention Framework

- Low-intensity users → Brief counselling & online support  
- Moderate users → Structured outpatient programs  
- High-intensity users → Residential / medication-assisted treatment  

### 4. Access & Stigma Reduction

- 24/7 anonymous helplines  
- Free online counselling  
- Subsidised treatment access  

Target: Engage 50–60% of help-seeking individuals within 2 years.
